                    Before two decades, a young man with dreams and visions in mind came from Deesa town of north Gujarat to the land of opportunities’ Mumbai’. Those were the high flying days for diamond trade and many youngsters from Palanpur, Deesa and other towns were joining diamond trade. The innovative and enterprising boy had stepped out of home with blessings of father – mother and lots of enthusiasm and the hard working ‘Honge Kamyaab’ spirit. He ventured into diamond business and even dreamt of some sincere ventures in show business. But destiny had planned something else for him. Goddess Saraswati was calling him to serve her through truth based journalism. Of course he occasionally wrote on diamond trade for couple of Gujarati newspapers and some magazines.But he never knew that it will be his profession, a mission. A friend told him that title of a weekly is available at some small price, if you want to go for it, try publishing a magazine. He thought positive and bought the title through court procedure. That was beginning of Hira Manek and a new era in life of Hardik Hundiya. Hardik Hundiya was amazed at the things happening with him He spoke to several diamond traders and friends regarding this new venture and received few calls to congratulate him. He received two advertisements. First one of Rs.21, 000 and second one of Rs.5,000,date of receipt was 30th January,1997.The process of preparing editorials, making pages etc was like a child trying to write ABC for the first time. When the first copy was received from press, joy of own creation was at peak. When he received calls of appreciation and analysis of written material in Hira Manek, It was like the child getting pats on back for good effort to write ABC. Since the first issue of Hira Manek, Hardik Hundiya had pledged not to publish things regarding thefts, dacoities, rape, violence, obscenity and things that harm Indian cultural values. In lieu to Jain and Hindu ethos, humanity and kindness to every living entity (Jeevdaya) always remain a priority for coverage. This value based journalism earned him (Hardik) very high prestige in diamond market and society as a whole. Because of those values, Hardik Hundiya could cultivate good friendship and respectful position among mainstream journalists’ fraternity of Mumbai..Hira Manek carved a diamond in personality of Hardik Hundiya. He got high social recognition and many awards, accolades, felicitations came to him. During all these years, he received many awards Helpful Citizen Awards, etc. Hardik Hundiya was felicitated by Justice Bhagwatiprasadjeee on behalf of the World peace foundation. He was founder president of Leo club of Deesa and treasurer of Mumbai regional Indira congress committee. He is executive committee member of Jain Samata Vahini. He convened several agitations against corruption and for protection of Indian culture. He is staunch opponent of obscenity in films, ads and any media Financial progress of Hira Manek inspired him to go ahead with publication of a Hindi weekly Star Report. His friendly, loving and warm nature made him not only popular, but also close to heart for many people across people from different languages, religions and regions. He got blessings from elders, saints, Gurubhagwants and love-affection, co operation from friends, neighbors all.Yes, he is ambitious. His ambition is to take all his colleagues, friends, relatives towards bright future in absolutely religious and ethical manner. He wants to serve the society with his mightier pen and wants to feel the ‘abhishek’ of blessings of goddess Saraswati forever. His progress mantra is ‘ Sahanavavatu,Sahanaubhanuktu. . . ‘Let’s move ahead to travel on path of words….
